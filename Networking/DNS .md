# DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human-readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine-readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44). 
- It is a phone book of the Internet. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, which other machines use to find the device.
- DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).
- Root DNS Server stores all the Top level domain e.g :- .io, .com, .org etc.
