Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller networks called as “subnets.”

### What is a Subnet?

- A subnet is like a smaller group within a large network. It is a way to split a large network into smaller networks so that devices present in one network can transmits data more easily. 
- For example, in a company, different departments can each have their own subnet, keeping their data traffic separate from others. 
- Subnet makes the network faster and easier to manage and also improves the security of the network.

### Structure and Types of IP Address

- IP addresses are an important part of the Internet. They are made up of a series of numbers or alphanumeric characters that help to identify devices on a network. 
- Almost every device we use is connected to the Internet, whether a smartphone, computer, or smart home device. For these devices to communicate with each other, they need a unique identifier, known as an IP address.

- IP address is divided into two parts: X1. X2. X3. X4
      
   1. [X1. X2. X3] is the Network ID
   2. [X4] is the Host ID

- Example IP Address: 192.168.1.15

   1. Network ID: 192.168.1 (This corresponds to [X1.X2.X3])
   2. Host ID: 15 (This corresponds to [X4])

### The version of The IP Address

- IPV4 (Internet Protocol Version 4): It is the first version of the Internet Protocol address. The address size of IPV4 is a 32-bit number. It has 4,294,967,296 addresses, but we are still seeing a shortage in network addresses as the use of network and virtual devices is increasing rapidly.

- IPV6 (Internet Protocol Version 6): It is the recent version of the Internet Protocol address. The address size of IPV6 is 128-bit number. It allows 3.4 x 10^38 unique IP addresses which seems to be more than sufficient to support trillions of internet devices  

### Types of IP Addresses

- Public
-  Private
-  Fixed
-  Dynamic

### What is a Subnet Mask?
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used in IP addressing to separate the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. It helps computers and devices determine which part of an IP address refers to the network they are present, and which part refers to their specific location or address within that network.


### The 32-bit IP address is divided into sub-classes

- Class A: The network ID is 8 bits long and the host ID is 24 bits long.
- Class B: The network ID is 16 bits long and the host ID is 16 bits long.
- Class C: The network ID is 24 bits long and the host ID is 8 bits long.

### What is CIDR?
- CIDR means a Classless Inter-Domain Routing. It is a way to give out the IP addresses on the internet more easily. 
- These IP addresses are like phone numbers for the computers and other devices that connect to the internet. Each device needs its own IP address to connect to the other devices online.
-  CIDR helps big companies and internet providers hand out these addresses in a smart way. It lets them use the available addresses better, so more devices can connect to the internet.
