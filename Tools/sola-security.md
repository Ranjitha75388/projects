## How Does Sola Work?
Sola provides a workspace where users can build, manage, and share security solutions.

### Key Components:

1️. **Data Sources** – Securely connect to cloud platforms and services for security monitoring.
    
 - **Supported Integrations**: AWS, GCP, Microsoft Azure, GitHub, and more.

2️. **Apps** – Pre-built security tools that can be customized:
    
- **Queries** – Search and analyze security data. 

- **Canvases** – Create dashboards and reports to visualize insights. 

- **Alerts** – Get notified when security risks or threats are detected. 

- **Workflows** (Coming Soon) – Automate security actions to respond faster. 

## How Sola Security Helps DevOps Teams?

Sola Security integrates with DevOps tools like GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to keep applications secure.

### Security in CI/CD Pipelines
   
• Finds security issues before deployment by scanning code for vulnerabilities. 

• Stops risky deployments by enforcing security policies. 

• **Example**: If an API key is exposed, Sola detects it and blocks deployment until fixed. 

### Cloud Security Monitoring
    
• Monitors cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) 24/7. 

• Sends instant alerts for security risks like public databases or weak passwords. 

• **Example**: If an Azure storage bucket is made public, Sola detects and alerts the team. 

### Automating Threat Response (Coming Soon)

• Blocks attacks by isolating compromised systems. 

• Restores safe configurations if something changes by mistake. 

• **Example**: If someone tries to log in from an unusual location, Sola locks the account and notifies the security team.

## Connecting Sola with Microsoft Azure
   
 Sola can integrate with Azure to monitor security risks and threats in real-time. 

 **Key Benefits:**
