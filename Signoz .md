## What is SigNoz?

- SigNoz is an open-source observability tool that helps to monitor:

  -  Logs

  - Metrics (e.g., CPU, memory)

  - Traces (e.g., request flow in microservices)

- Itâ€™s an alternative to tools like DataDog, New Relic.
 
- SigNoz collects data using **OpenTelemetry (OTel**) and stores it in **ClickHouse**, a high-performance columnar database. We interact with it via a modern UI that offers dashboards, queries, and alerting.

- SigNoz in two ways:

  - Cloud	Hosted -By SigNoz team.
  -  Self-hosted - We can install on our server

## What is OpenTelemetry (OTel)?

- OpenTelemetry is a standard for collecting and exporting logs, metrics, and traces from applications.

   - Collector: A service that receives, processes, and forwards telemetry data.

  - Protocol: OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol), used for sending data.

  - SDKs: Language-specific tools you can add to your app to generate telemetry.
