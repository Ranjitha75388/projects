Linux Assessment-1

1.Which command is used to move a file from one directory to another? 


2.How do you change the permissions of a file to be readable, writable, and executable by the owner only? 


3.What command would you use to rename a directory called oldfolder to newfolder? 


4.What is the command to display all active processes running on your system? 


5.What is the command to check the available free memory on your system? 

6.What command would you use to delete a directory named myfolder along with all its contents, including files and subdirectories? 


7.What is the command to find the size of all files and directories, sorted in descending order? 

8.How would you recursively change the ownership of all files in a directory, but only for files and not for subdirectories?

9.Which command would you use to display disk space usage in human-readable format, but only for a specific directory and its subdirectories? 


10.Use the ping command to check the connectivity to google.com. What result indicates that the server is reachable? 


11.How do you check the size of all files in a directory that are larger than 50MB?


12.What command would you use to find and delete files older than 1 day in a specific directory?


13.What is the difference between df and du commands? When should you use each?       

14.What is the difference between using symbolic mode (chmod u+x) and numeric mode (chmod 755) with the chmod command, and when would you prefer one over the other?                      chmod(u+x)gives permission to user to execute a file...  


15.You want to make a script executable by the owner and readable by the group, but no permissions for others. Which chmod command would you use, and how do you interpret the permission setting?


16.How would you list the top 2 processes consuming the most memory on a Linux system? 


17.A user accidentally changes the permissions on an entire directory structure, making it inaccessible to the root user (chmod 000 /user/directory). How can you regain access to the directory and its contents? 


18.You are tasked with setting up a shared directory for a group of developers, but you need to ensure that any files they create in the directory are owned by the group, not the individual user. What combination of commands and configurations would you use to achieve this?

19.A server is experiencing high load, and some processes seem to be consuming excessive memory. Youâ€™ve been tasked to identify the specific processes causing the issue and terminate them. How would you approach this task using available Linux commands? 

20.Explain how SSH (Secure Shell) works and describe the difference between password-based authentication and key-based authentication. Which method is more secure, and why? 
(Presentation for 1 to 2 mins).
