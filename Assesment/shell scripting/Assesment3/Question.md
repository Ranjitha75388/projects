Step 1: Write a shell script named setup_project.sh that performs the following actions:
 
a. Creates a directory named project_setup.
b. Inside project_setup, creates two files:
	README.md with a description of the project.
	config.txt containing initial configuration settings (e.g., SERVER_NAME, ENVIRONMENT, and PORT).
 
Step 2: Initialize a Git repository locally, commit the setup_project.sh script, and push it to a new branch (e.g., feature/setup-script) in a GitHub repository.
           Create a pull request from the feature/setup-script branch to the main branch on GitHub.
 
Step 3: SSH into a remote server, clone the setup_project.sh script from GitHub, make it executable, and run it.
