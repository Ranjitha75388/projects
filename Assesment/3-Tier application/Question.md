Hello Everyone, Here attached a sample 3 tier application which contains
Tier -1 : ReactJS Frontend
Tier -2: Java SpringBoot backend
Tier -3: MySQL Database
 
- And the attachment contains the information about how to build and run the application on your local machine.
- Please follow that and make the application running on your local machine successfully.
- Then dockerize the complete application ie
- Custom dockerfile for each tier
- Frontend and Backend must be in a network , Backend and Database must be in another network
- Frontend container must not be able to access the Database at any cost
- Attach local volume to Database container and it should be persistence even after the deletion and recreation of the complete stack.
- Please feel free to ask you question incase if anything is not clear.
Recommendation:
- read the project completely and the readme in the attachment too 
- try to deploy the application on the local machine and understand how it works
- think about how to dockerize the complete project
- write down the plan how to implement
- draw an architecture and flowchart / flow diagram with all the possibilities, and develop one-by-one
- track all your action in a github repo (try to use maximum git concepts)
