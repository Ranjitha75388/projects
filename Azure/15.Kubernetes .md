# Kubernetes 

##  What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (also called **K8s**) is an open-source platform used to manage applications that run in containers. It helps you:

- Deploy apps automatically
- Scale them up or down when needed
- Keep them running, even if something crashes

Kubernetes is like a **robotic manager** for your app containers!

## 🏢 Kubernetes Cluster Overview

A **Kubernetes cluster** is a group of computers that work together to run your containerized applications. These computers are divided into two main parts:

### 1. Control Plane (The Brain)

- Makes decisions: Where should apps go? When should they start or stop?
- Manages the overall health of the system
- Controls the cluster
- Typically, for **high availability**, a production cluster should have **at least 3 Control Plane nodes**, so if one fails, the others can continue managing the cluster.

### 2. Worker Nodes (The Workers)

- Actual computers that run the apps
- They get instructions from the Control Plane
- A cluster can have **1 or many worker nodes** based on the load

---

## 🛋️ Control Plane Components (Detailed)

### ✉️ API Server

- Entry gate for all commands (like creating pods)
- Accepts commands from CLI (`kubectl`)
- Verifies and sends them to other components
- The only component that directly communicates with users

### ⚖️ Scheduler

- Chooses the best worker node for new applications (Pods)
- Based on CPU, RAM, and availability
- Decides placement of new Pods

### ✈️ Controller Manager

- Makes sure everything is as it should be
- If a pod crashes, it recreates it
- Manages different controllers:
  - Node controller (checks if nodes are healthy)
  - Replication controller (manages replica pods)
  - Endpoints controller (joins services & pods)

### 🔢 etcd (Cluster Database)

- A simple key-value store
- Remembers cluster state
- Tells control plane what exists in the system
- Highly available: Runs on multiple Control Plane nodes

---

## ⚙ Node Components (Detailed)

### 🛋 Node

- A machine (real or virtual) in the cluster
- Runs apps (pods) given by the Control Plane
- Can have different OS types (Linux/Windows)

### 💾 Container Runtime

- Software that runs the containers
- Examples: Docker, containerd, CRI-O
- Pulls container images and runs them

### 🛼 kubelet

- Talks to Control Plane
- Tells the node what to do (start pod, stop pod)
- Ensures containers described in PodSpec are running

### 🧵 kube-proxy

- Handles networking
- Sends traffic to the right pod
- Implements rules for pod communication
- Can use iptables or IPVS for routing

## 🛁 Understanding Pods, Containers, Nodes

| Term          | Simple Explanation                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Container** | An app and everything it needs to run   |
| **Pod**       | A wrapper around one or more containers |
| **Node**      | A machine that runs Pods                |
| **Cluster**   | Group of Nodes                          |
| **Control Plane** | Group of components managing the cluster |
| **Replica**   | A copy of a pod                         |

## 🔹 Add-ons (Optional Plugins)

### CoreDNS

- Lets pods find each other by name
- Handles internal DNS requests

### Calico

- Provides secure communication between pods
- Handles networking and policies

### KubeVirt

- Lets you run VMs inside Kubernetes
- Helps mix VMs with container apps

### ACI (Application Container Interface)

- Helps run containers across different platforms
- Improves portability and flexibility

## 🔎 Common Kubectl Commands

| Action         | Command                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| List Pods      | `kubectl get pods`            |
| List Nodes     | `kubectl get nodes`           |
| List Services  | `kubectl get services`        |
| Describe a Pod | `kubectl describe pod <name>` |
| Delete a Pod   | `kubectl delete pod <name>`   |
| Get All Resources | `kubectl get all`         |

## ✅ Benefits of Using Kubernetes

- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts apps if they crash
- **Scalability**: Adds or removes containers based on usage
- **Rolling Updates**: Update apps without downtime
- **Load Balancing**: Shares traffic evenly
- **Portable**: Works on laptops, servers, or cloud
- **Secure**: Isolates and controls app communication
- **Declarative Configuration**: You describe what you want, Kubernetes does it

| Node            | One restaurant branch          |
| Pod             | A kitchen                      |
| Container       | A chef with tools (the app)    |
| Scheduler       | Manager assigning tasks        |
| Controller      | Supervisor watching everything |
| API Server      | Front desk taking orders       |
| Kubelet         | Head chef executing orders     |
| Kube Proxy      | Waiter delivering food         |
