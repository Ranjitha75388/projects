Step 1: Install OpenSSL (If Not Already Installed)

Run these commands on your local machine to ensure OpenSSL is installed:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssl -y
```
Step 2: Generate a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

Run the following command to generate a self-signed SSL certificate for your domain:
replace CN=Domain name
```
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
-keyout mycert.key -out mycert.crt -subj "/CN=orangesea-26381e22.centralindia.azurecontainerapps.io"
```
This creates:

    mycert.key → Private Key
    mycert.crt → SSL Certificate
Step 3: Convert SSL Certificate to PFX Format (Required for Azure)

Azure only accepts .pfx format, so convert your SSL certificate:
```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out mycert.pfx -inkey mycert.key -in mycert.crt
```
You will be asked for a password → Remember this password!

 This creates:

    mycert.pfx → SSL Certificate in PFX format
Step 4: Upload SSL Certificate to Azure Application Gateway

Now, go to Azure Portal and upload the certificate:

    Go to Azure Application Gateway
    Click on "Listeners" → Add a new HTTPS Listener
    Select HTTPS as the protocol
    Upload mycert.pfx file
    Enter the password (the one you set during conversion)
    Click Save

    Step 5: Configure Backend & HTTPS Routing

    Go to "Backend Pools" → Select your frontend container app
    Set Backend Port: 3000 (if your React app runs on 3000)
    Go to "HTTP Settings"
        Enable HTTPS (443)
        Select the same SSL certificate
    Go to "Rules"
        Create a new routing rule for HTTPS
