### Nodes

- The main component of the Kubernetes architecture is a resource called as a **Node**.
- Nodes are individual computers or VMs.

### Cluster

-  When these Nodes are connected together, you will get a Kubernetes cluster.
-  Example, if you connect 3 VMs (Nodes), you will have a Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes.
-  Every workload that you deploy to the cluster runs on a particular node.
-  This node is either auto-selected by one of the Kubernetes components called the **kube-scheduler**, or you can manually define some rules on which node the workload should run. 

### Two Types of Nodes

1. Control Plane Node

   -  This is the "brain" of the cluster.

   - It makes all the important decisions — like where to run apps, checking health, managing updates, etc.

   - It holds all the critical parts that help Kubernetes work.

   - If this node goes down and there's only one — the whole system could stop working.That’s why, in real-life systems (like big websites or businesses), people use more than one Control Plane  — so that if one goes down, the others keep everything running.

   - This setup is called High Availability (HA) — it makes your Kubernetes system more reliable and safe.

2. Worker Node

   - These are the "employees" or "workers".

   - The worker node (or minion) as it is also known, is were the containers are hosted.

   - They actually run your apps.

   - They listen to the Control Plane for instructions.
   - Worker nodes can be scaled up or down depending on how much traffic or load your application has.
